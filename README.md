Welcome to your one-stop shop for making Steam games actually work on Linux! This collection of scripts tackles the most common Proton headaches so you can get back to what matters: dying repeatedly in Dark Souls.

## 🤔 What's This About?
Steam's Proton is amazing... when it works. When it doesn't, you're left staring at error messages that look like they were written by a caffeinated developer at 3 AM. This project provides ready-made scripts to solve the most common Proton problems without requiring a PhD in Wine configuration.

## 🚀 Quick Start
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/SlackerBahadir/fix-my-proton.git
cd fix-my-proton
pip install -r requirements.txt
python fixmyproton.py --help
```

## 🐧 Supported Distributions
- Arch Linux (btw)
- Probably others (i not tested)

## 🎮 Game-Specific Fixes
Check the `scripts/` directory for game-specific fixes.
